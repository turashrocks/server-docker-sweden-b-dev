Hello
Welcome to the instructions of my assignment. Below are the contents for the system:

0) Github locations for Laravel and Vue
server-docker-lara8-php7.4 - contains the Laravel app. The instructions to run the server are given in Readme.md
dashboard-vue3-for-server-docker-lara8-php7.4-: contains the vue3 app

1) Docker Run with Laravel, Phpmyadmin, nginx
Now I will run the docker instance.
As you can see the app is running along with Phpmyadmin
2) Postman API display
Now I will display the postman and some API endpoints.
Department and Result API endpoints can perform CRUD
2) Vue3 Frontend
Now I will turn on the Vue3 Frontend.
All login operations are being done with JWT Token. No passport or sanctum used

There are tons of ways to improve. I hope you like my presentation. Thank you
